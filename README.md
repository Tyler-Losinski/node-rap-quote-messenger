Node Rap Quote Messenger
========================

This is a simple application I made for a friend that sends out a daily rap quote via text.  
The app was written in Node.js and is hosted on a Heroku server.

## How It Works

That application does three things:
1. It scrapes the website www.rapquote.com for daily rap quotes.
2. Formats the text and selects a random quote 
3. Breaks the quote up into 145 character blocks and sends them via email over cell providers sms gateways 

## Want to receive a daily quote?

Create an issue with your email or phone number and I'd be glad to add you. :)
